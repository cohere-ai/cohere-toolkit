## Assumptions

Before contributing, please ensure:
1. You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) workflow.
2. You've read [Cohere's documentation](https://docs.cohere.com).
3. You know about the [Cohere community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/co-mmunity).

## How to Contribute

1. **Open or Find an Issue**  
   Ensure your contribution addresses an open issue. This helps gauge if the change will be accepted.
   
2. **Fork the Repository**  
   [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) to your GitHub account.

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Work on your fork and ensure [your commits are signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
   [Submit your fork as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch. A maintainer will review your PR, but response times may vary.

## How to Add Features

Add new features to the `community` folder. This is where tools and deployments not managed by Codeowners are located.
