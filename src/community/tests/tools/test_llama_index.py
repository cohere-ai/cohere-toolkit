            "text": "Location of the Mariana TrenchMariana Trench\nThe Mariana Trench is an oceanic trench located in the\nwestern Pacific Ocean, about 200 kilometres (124 mi)\neast of the Mariana Islands; it is the deepest oceanic\ntrench on Earth. It is crescent-shaped and measures\nabout 2,550 km (1,580 mi) in length and 69 km (43 mi)\nin width. The maximum know n depth is 10,984 ± 25\nmetres (36,037 ± 82 ft; 6,006 ± 14 fathoms;\n6.825 ± 0.016 mi) at the southern end of a small slot-\nshaped valley in its floor know n as the Challenger\nDeep.[1] The deepest point of the trench is more than\n2 km (1.2 mi) farther from sea level than the peak of\nMount Everest.[a]\nAt the bottom of the trench, the water column above\nexerts a pressure of 1,086 bar (15,750 psi), more than\n1,071 times the standard atmospheric pressure at sea\nlevel. At this pressure, the density of water is increased\nby 4.96% . The temperature at the bottom is 1 to 4 °C (34\nto 39 ° F).[4]\nIn 2009, the Mariana Trench was established as a US\nNational Monum ent.[5]\nOne-celled organisms called monothalamea have been\nfound in the trench at a record depth of 10.6 km (35,000 ft; 6.6 mi) below the sea surface by researchers\nfrom Scripps Institution of Oceanography. [6] Data has also sugge sted that microbial life forms thrive within\nthe trench.[7][8]\nThe Mariana Trench is named after the nearby Mariana Islands, which are named Las Marianas in hono r of\nSpanish Queen Mariana of Austria. The islands are part of the island arc that is formed on an over-riding\nplate, called the Mariana Plate (also named for the islands), on t he western side of the trench.\nThe Mariana Trench is part of the Izu–Bonin–M ariana subduc tion system that forms the bounda ry between\ntwo tectonic plates. In this system, the western edge of one plate, the Pacific Plate, is subduc ted (i.e., thrust)\nbeneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west. Crustal material at the western edge of the Pacific\nPlate is some of the oldest oceanic crust on Earth (up to 170 million years old), and is, therefore, cooler and\ndenser; hence its great height difference relative to the higher-riding (and younge r) Mariana Plate. The\ndeepest area at the plate bounda ry is the Mariana Trench proper.Coordinates: 11°21′N 142°12′E\nEtymology\nGeology"

            "text": 'The Pacific plate is subducted beneath the Mariana Plate,\ncreating the Mariana trench, and (further on) the arc of the\nMariana Islands, as water trapped in the plate is released\nand explodes upward to form island volcanoes and\nearthquakes.\nOcean trenches in the western\nPacificThe movement of the Pacific and Mariana\nplates is also indirectly respons ible for the\nformation of the Mariana Islands. These\nvolcanic islands are caused by flux melting of\nthe uppe r mantle due to the release of water\nthat is trapped in minerals of the subducted\nportion of  the Pacific Plate.\nThe trench was first sounde d during the\nChallenger expedition in 1875 using a\nweighted rope, which recorded a depth of\n4,475 fathoms (8,184 metres; 26,850\nfeet).[9][10] In 1877, a map was published\ncalled Tiefenkarte des Grossen Ozeans ("Depth\nmap of the Great Ocean") by Petermann,\nwhich showed a Challenger Tief ("Challenger deep") at the location\nof that soundi ng. In 1899, USS Nero, a conve rted collier, recorded\na depth of 5,269 f athoms (9,636 m etres; 31,614 f eet).[11]\nIn 1951, unde r Chief Scientist Thomas Gaskell, Challenger II\nsurveyed the trench using echo sounding, a much more precise and\nvastly easier way to measure depth than the soundi ng equipment\nand drag lines used in the original expedition. During this survey,\nthe deepest part of the trench was recorded when the Challenger II\nmeasured a depth of 5,960 fathoms (10,900 metres; 35,760 feet) at\n11°19′N 142° 15′E,[12] know n as the Challenger Deep.[13]\nIn 1957, the Soviet vessel Vityaz reported a depth of 11,034 m\n(36,201 ft; 6,033 fathoms) at a location dubbe d the Mariana\nHollow.[14]\nIn 1962, the surface ship M.V. Spencer F. Baird recorded a\nmaximum depth of 10,915 m (35,810  ft; 5,968 fathoms) using\nprecision depth gauges.\nIn 1984, the Japanese survey vessel Takuyō (拓洋 ) collected data\nfrom the Mariana Trench using a narrow, multi-beam echo sounde r;\nit reported a maximum depth of 10,924 metres (35,840 ft), also\nreported as 10,920 ± 10 m (35,827 ± 33 ft; 5,971.1 ± 5.5 fathoms).[15] Remotely Operated Vehicle KAIKO\nreached the deepest area of the Mariana Trench and made the deepest diving record of 10,91 1 m (35,797 ft;\n5,966 f athoms) on 24 M arch 1995.[16]\nDuring surveys carried out between 1997 and 2001, a spot was found along the Mariana Trench that had a\ndepth similar to the Challenger Deep, possibly even deeper. It was discovered while scientists from the\nHawaii Institute of Geophys ics and Planetology were completing a survey around Guam; they used a sonar\nmapping system towed behind the research ship to conduc t the survey. This new spot was named the\nHMRG (Hawaii Mapping R esearch Group) Deep, after the group of  scientists who di scovered it.[17]Research history'

            "text": "The bathyscaphe Trieste (designed\nby Auguste Piccard), the first crewed\nvehicle to reach the bottom of the\nMariana Trench[22]On 1 June 2009, mapping aboard the RV Kilo Moana  (mothership of the Nereus vehicle), indicated a spot\nwith a depth of 10,971 m (35,994 ft; 5,999 fathoms). The sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep was\npossible by its Simrad EM120 sonar multibeam bathymetry system for deep water. The sonar system uses\nphase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2%  of water depth across the entire\nswath (implying that the depth figure is accurate to ± 22 m etres (72 ft; 12 fathoms)).[18][19]\nIn 2011, it was announc ed at the American Geophys ical Union Fall Meeting that a US Navy hydrographic\nship equipped with a multibeam echosounde r conduc ted a survey which mapped the entire trench to 100 m\n(330 ft; 55 fathoms) resolution.[2] The mapping revealed the existence of four rocky outcrops thought  to be\nformer seamounts.[20]\nThe Mariana Trench is a site chosen by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and the Woods\nHole Oceanographic Institution in 2012 for a seismic survey to investigate the subsurface water cycle.\nUsing both ocean-bottom seismometers and hydrophone s, the scientists are able to map structures as deep\nas 97 ki lometres (318,000 f t; 53,000 f athoms; 60 m i) beneath the surface.[21]\nAs of 2022, 22 crewed descents and seven uncrewed descents have\nbeen achieved. The first was the crewed descent by Swiss-\ndesigned, Italian-built, United States Navy-owned bathyscaphe\nTrieste, which reached the bottom at 1:06 pm on 23 January 1960,\nwith Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard on board.[13][23] Iron shot\nwas used for ballast, with gasoline for buoya ncy.[13] The onboa rd\nsystems indicated a depth of 37,800  feet (11,521 m; 6,300\nfathoms),[24] but this was later revised to 35,814 feet (10,916 m;\n5,969 fathoms).[25] The depth was estimated from a conve rsion of\npressure measured and calculations based on the water density from\nsea surface to seabed.[23]\nThis was followed by the uncrewed ROVs Kaikō in 1996 and\nNereus in 2009. The first three expeditions directly measured very\nsimilar depths of 10,902 to 10,916 m (35,768 to 35,814 ft; 5,961 to\n5,969 fathoms).[26][27] The fourth was made by Canadian film director James Cameron on 26 March 2012.\nHe reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench in the submersible vessel Deepsea Challenger, diving to a\ndepth of 10,908 m  (35,787 f t; 5,965 f athoms).[28][29][30]\nIn July 2015, members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oregon State University,\nand the Coast Guard submerged a hydrophone  into the deepest part of the Mariana Trench, the Challenger\nDeep, never having previously deployed one past a mile. The titanium-shelled hydrophone  was designed to\nwithstand the immense pressure 7 mi (37,000 ft; 6,200 fathoms; 11,000 m) unde r.[31] Although researchers\nwere unable to retrieve the hydrophone  until November, the data capacity was full within the first 23 days.\nAfter months of analyzing the sounds , the experts were surprised to pick up natural sounds  like\nearthqua kes, typhoons , baleen whales, and machine-made sounds  such as boats.[32] Due to the mission's\nsuccess, the researchers announc ed plans to deploy a second hydrophone  in 2017 for an extended period of\ntime.\nVictor Vescovo achieved a new record descent to 10,92 8 m (35,853 ft; 5,976 fathoms) on 28 April 2019\nusing the DSV Limiting Factor, a Triton 36000/ 2 model manufactured by Florida-based Triton Submarines.\nHe dived four times between 28 A pril and 5 May 2019, becoming the first person to dive into Challenger\nDeep more than onc e.[33][34][35]D e s c e n t s"

Vityaz-D is the first unde rwater vehicle to operate\nautonom ously at the extreme depths of the Mariana Trench. The duration of the mission, excluding diving\nand surfacing, w as more than 3 hour s.[36][37]\nOn 10 November 2020, the Chinese submersible Fendouz he reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench at a\ndepth of 10,909 m  (35,791 f t; 5,965 f athoms).[38][39]\nThe expedition conduc ted in 1960 claimed to have observed, with great surprise because of the high\npressure, large creatures living at the bottom, such as a flatfish about 30 cm (12 in) long,[24] and shrimp.[40]\nAccording to Piccard, "The bottom appeared light and clear, a waste of firm diatomaceous ooze".[24] Many\nmarine biologists are now skeptical of the suppos ed sighting of the flatfish, and it is sugge sted that the\ncreature may instead have been a sea cucumber.[41][42] During the second expedition, the uncrewed vehicle\nKaikō collected mud samples from the seabed.[43] Tiny or ganisms were found t o be living in those samples.\nIn July 2011, a research expedition deployed untethered landers, called drop cams, equipped with digital\nvideo cameras and lights to explore this deep-sea region. Among many other living organisms, some\ngigantic single-celled foraminiferans with a size of more than 10 cm (4 in), belonging to the class of\nmonothalamea, were observed.[44] Monothalamea are noteworthy for their size, their extreme abunda nce on\nthe seafloor, and their role as hosts for a variety of organisms.\nIn December 2014, a new species of snailfish was discovered at a depth of 8,145 m (26,722 ft; 4,454\nfathoms), breaking the previous record for the deepest living fish seen on vi deo.[45]\nDuring the 2014 expedition, several new species were filmed, including huge amphipods  know n as\nsupergiants. Deep-sea gigantism is the process where species grow larger than their shallow-water\nrelatives.[45]\nIn May 2017, a n uni dentified type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8,178 m etres (26,800 f t).[46]\nIn 2016, a research expedition looke d at the chemical makeup of crustacean scavengers collected from the\nrange of 7,841–10,250 m (25,725–33 ,629 ft; 4,288–5,605 fathoms) within the trench. Within these\norganisms, the researchers found extremely elevated concentrations of PCBs, a chemical toxin banned in\nthe 1970s  for its environmental harm, concentrated at all depths within the sediment of the trench.[47]\nFurther research has found that amphipods  also ingest microplastics, with 100%  of amphipods having at\nleast one piece of synthetic material in their stomachs.[48][49]\nIn 2019, Victor Vescovo reported finding a plastic bag and candy wrappers at the bottom of the trench.[50]\nThat year, Scientific American also reported that carbon-14 from nuclear bomb testing has been found in the\nbodies of aquatic animals found i n the trench.[51]Life\nP o l l u t i o n\nPossible nuclear waste disposal site'
