"""Functions for handling operations with deployments.

This module contains functions for handling backend operations with deployments. A Deployment
represents the information required to interact with an LLM. New deployments are defined
by creating a class that inherits from BaseDeployment and implementing the required methods in
the model_deployments directory.

Deployments can be configured in two different ways: by providing appropriate config values
through the config (which itself should be set in a configuration.yaml file, or through setting
environment variables), or by dynamically defining a deployment in the database through the
deployment_crud module. This service attempts to abstract the differences between these two
styles so that higher layers don't need to know about these differences.

We assume that for each kind of deployment, it will be configured either through the config or
through the database, but not both. If a deployment is configured in the database, it is assumed
to the be the correct definition.
