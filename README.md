## Try Now:
There are two main ways for quickly running Toolkit: local and cloud. See the specific instructions given below. 
### Local
*You will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Docker-compose >= 2.22](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. [Go here for a more detailed setup.](/docs/setup.md)*  
Note: to include community tools when building locally, set the `INSTALL_COMMUNITY_DEPS` build arg in the `docker-compose.yml` to `true`.

Both options will make the frontend available at http://localhost:4000.

#### Using `make`
Use the provided Makefile to simplify and automate your development workflow with Cohere Toolkit, including Docker Compose management, testing, linting, and environment setup.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit.git
cd cohere-toolkit
make first-run
```



#### Docker Compose only
Use Docker Compose directly if you want to quickly spin up and manage your container environment without the additional automation provided by the Makefile.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohere-ai/cohere-toolkit.git
cd cohere-toolkit
docker compose up
docker compose run --build backend alembic -c src/backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
```
### Cloud
#### GitHub Codespaces

To run this project using GitHub Codespaces, please refer to our [Codespaces Setup Guide](/docs/github_codespaces.md).
